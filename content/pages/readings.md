More Advanced Readings
----------------------

There are some excellent graduate-level textbooks on cosmology that some of you might want to look at. These books are well beyond the level of this course, but I mention them in case any of you become interested in pursuing some topic at a more advanced level. The first two are written from the astrophysical point of view, while the last five describe the early universe more from the particle physicists' slant:
